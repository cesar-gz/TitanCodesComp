# TitanCodes solved problems

### Hosted by CSUF ACM club
This was a beginner friendly programming competition. We were in teams and given a set of 48 possible problems to solve within a time limit.
I pushed the five problems I was able to solve. Hosted on Janurary 20th 2023 on campus. Each question was worth points.

submissions were submitted at https://titancodes.acmcsuf.com/

This was a fun social event where I met a lot of people and learned what a programming competition was about
